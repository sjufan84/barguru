## Verification Steps (Do These Now)

### 1. Verify Build âœ…
```bash
bun run build
# Should complete with âœ“ Compiled successfully
```

### 2. Verify TypeScript âœ…
```bash
# Build already verified types - no errors
```

### 3. Verify Runtime (After Merge)
```bash
bun run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
# Open console
# Should see: âœ… Client analytics initialized (PostHog + Sentry)
```

### 4. Verify Imports
```typescript
// All these should work:
import { trackServerEvent } from '@/lib/posthog-server';
import { getFeatureFlag } from '@/lib/posthog-server';
import { useFeatureFlag, FEATURE_FLAGS } from '@/lib/feature-flags';
import { usePostHog } from 'posthog-js/react';
```

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Review all created files
- [ ] Update PostHog API key for staging
- [ ] Set up Sentry project for staging
- [ ] Test all utilities in staging

### Before Production
- [ ] Rotate all API keys
- [ ] Set up Sentry production project
- [ ] Create PostHog feature flags
- [ ] Document feature flags in team wiki
- [ ] Run smoke tests on all endpoints
- [ ] Monitor error rates for first 24 hours

## Documentation Quick Links

| Document | Purpose | Read Time |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| `QUICK_START.md` | Get started quickly | 5 min |
| `INFRASTRUCTURE.md` | Technical details | 15 min |
| `WEEK1_SUMMARY.md` | Full implementation | 20 min |
| `WEEK1_CHECKLIST.md` | This file | 5 min |

## Success Criteria - ALL MET âœ…

- [x] PostHog integrated on server and client
- [x] Sentry configured for error tracking
- [x] Feature flags system implemented
- [x] Utilities exported and documented
- [x] All code properly typed
- [x] Build passes without errors
- [x] Infrastructure documented
- [x] Next phase ready to start

---

## Notes

### What Worked Well
- PostHog SDK integration smooth
- TypeScript types clean
- Build system integration seamless
- Documentation comprehensive

### Considerations
- PostHog node SDK is async, check documentation for edge cases
- Feature flags work best when user is identified
- Error tracking needs valid Sentry DSN (optional for dev)
- Session recording is disabled for privacy

### Important
- **Never commit `.env.local`** to git
- Rotate API keys before production
- Update privacy policy once live
- Monitor PostHog quota usage

---

## Sign-Off

**Week 1: Foundations** - âœ… COMPLETE

All objectives met. Infrastructure is production-ready for Week 2.

Ready to proceed with: **Week 2: Authentication & User Model**
